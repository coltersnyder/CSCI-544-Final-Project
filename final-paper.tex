\begin{abstract}
Realistic snow physics has been a dream in computer graphics since we first could make 3D graphics. This is now possible to a large degree all thanks to tessellation shaders. It was not long after tessellation shaders were introduced that accurate snow physics were being created. This paper seeks to explore the most basic type of snow simulation through the study of snow print depression.

Since the early days of computer graphics, snow physics took shape in the form of footprint textures that would show when the character would walk but beyond that no
